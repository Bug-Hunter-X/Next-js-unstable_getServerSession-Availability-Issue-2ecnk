```javascript
import { unstable_getServerSession } from 'next-auth';
import { authOptions } from './auth/[...nextauth]';

export default async function Page() {
  const session = await unstable_getServerSession(authOptions);

  // ... rest of your component
}
```
This code snippet attempts to use `unstable_getServerSession` from `next-auth`.  The issue is that this function might not always be available in all versions or configurations of Next.js, leading to runtime errors.  The instability implies it's subject to change, and the exact behavior is not guaranteed.
